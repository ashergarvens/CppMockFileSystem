# Studio 18
1. Katherine, Tanner, Asher
2. We want to keep the fileFactory fileSystem ow. we would need to make a bunch of create file methods that all create the 
   specific files of that specific type.
3. You have to modify way less code and you only have to edit the create abstract file method to have another if branch 
   in order to make a new file type since it dynamically creates a new file of that type. This method also has the 
   advantage of being more modular 
4. We tested everything in the main file for this studio and we initially got errors because we did not step up the code
   correctly but after we did set it up right we ran the code and got the following results: we had no errors and we
   tried everything that the instructions asked us to do with no errors.
