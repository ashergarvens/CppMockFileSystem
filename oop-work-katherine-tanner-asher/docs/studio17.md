1. Tanner Sharon, Asher Garvens, Katherine Fang
2. We tested all the 'X's and ' ' in a grid, and we tested incorrect formatting input. Everything worked as expected on the first try of the tests.
3. Programming a client to use an interface is more dynamic and less rigid. Making changes to the base class is now easier and
   we have less dependencies in our code.
4. We only have to change createFile because every other method in SimpleFileSystem uses abstractFile types to handle the files.
5. It does not depend on any concrete file types! It only works with abstract file pointers in order to do this.
